The Masque of the Red Death

The “[0>]Red Death[<0]” had long devastated the country. No pestilence had been ever so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was [0>]its[<0] Avatar and [0>]its[<0] seal — the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleedings at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest-ban which shut [5>]him[<5] out from the aid and from the sympathy of [5>]his[<5] fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the [0>]disease[<0] were the incidents of half an hour.

But the **[1>]Prince Prospero[<1]** was happy and dauntless, and sagacious. When [1>]his[<1] dominions were half depopulated, [1>]he[<1] summoned to [1>]his[<1] presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of [1>]his[<1], castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the [1>]prince[<1]’s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair from without or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With such [3>]precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. [4>]The external world[<3] could take care of itself[<4]. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The [1>]prince[<1] had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were _improvisatori_, there were ballêt-dancers, there were musicians, there were cards, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the “[0>]Red Death[<0].”
